A disconnect between brain and feeling. So it took me the best part of an hour to make sense of what I had seen. But the simple truth is this. Today I saw a man die. A police officer, someone I had almost certainly said “hello” to at some point over the years. Possibly even this morning. Who knows?</p><p>It was about 2.50pm when a reporter from Bloomberg came running into the Guardian office in the House of Commons to say <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/parliament-attack-police-officer-four-dead-westminster">there had been an incident outside</a>. I ran into the offices of the Daily Telegraph that overlook New Palace Yard to see two bodies lying near the entrance to Westminster Hall, just yards from where Airey Neave had been murdered nearly 40 years previously. <br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/22/the-numbing-afternoon-when-i-saw-a-police-officer-die-outside-parliament">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Global markets stabilise as investors await the first key test of whether President Trump will be able to able to press ahead with growth-boosting policies </p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2017-03-23T09:14:15.095Z">9.14am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>European markets are in a subdued mood this morning as investors await the crucial US vote on the healthcare bill which seeks to overturn Obamacare.</strong></p><p>With many opposed to the bill in its current form, investors are concerned that should Trump lose the vote, his growth-boosting policy promises might not materialse.</p><p>The markets got off to an understandably quiet start this Thursday, the European indices gently slipping into the red after the bell.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons why investors may be sitting on their hands this morning. Firstly, the tragedy in Westminster on Wednesday is the kind of event that casts the cold light of perspective on the stock market’s frivolities. </p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2017-03-23T08:58:57.982Z">8.58am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital, says that investors knew what was coming from the retailer in the form of the first profit drop in eight years.</strong></p><p>Not a pretty set of figures from Next but no worse than expected after warning on profits in January. Following that dire Christmas trading update investors were prepared for this and the retailer remains extremely cautious about the year ahead.</p><p>It was the first drop in annual profits in 8 years but investors seem to be reassured that it’s taking steps to turn things around with a focus on core products. <br></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2017/mar/23/markets-pause-ahead-of-crucial-us-healthcare-vote-business-live">Continue reading...</a>

Last year he toured the country as a Trump surrogate, was one of few black <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/rnc-2016-sheriff-dave-clarke-225768">speakers</a> at the Republican national convention, and today regularly airs his provocative views on race and policing on Fox News. Sean Hannity, writing in a foreword to Clarke’s new book, Cop Under Fire, calls him “America’s sheriff”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/23/david-clarke-jr-milwaukee-sheriff-trump">Continue reading...</a>

The president’s useful anti-feminists legitimise a slide towards a patriarchal society – and offer no political challenge to his macho leadership<p>Strength, patriotism, patriarchal values and a macho leadership style characterise Vladimir Putin’s current term as president. Strangely, this traditionalist authoritarian agenda has often been promoted by women.</p><p>The few Russian women who are represented in the highest federal posts – just 15.8% of the parliamentarians in the Duma, three of its 33 ministers and three of 85 regional governors – are usually responsible for “social policies” – healthcare, education, or social issues. Many female MPs are elected in accordance with common stereotypes of female leaders – celebrities, cosmonauts, Olympic champions and television hosts. All are expected to be cooperative and family oriented: in December, several female MPs protested against long parliamentary sessions, saying they needed to be home in time to feed their husbands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/vladimir-allies-russias-iron-ladies-useful-anti-feminists">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>Before a George Michael tribute night at the Sydney Opera House, the Australian singer reflects on the artist who changed him and how sanitising his life disrespects his legacy</p><p>In a year that had already taken two my greatest heroes and influences (Bowie and Prince), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/dec/25/george-michael-pop-superstar-dies-at-53">the news of George Michael’s death</a> arrived with shock and disappointment that moved swiftly to “of course this happened”. It was, after all, the year of the celebrity grim reaper. </p><p>When I heard he had died, I thought of the very brief time I spent with George Michael a few years earlier, at a gala at Elton John’s house. It was the White Tie and Tiaras Ball fundraiser for Elton’s AIDS charity, and I spent the night dressed to the nines, cavorting with Adam Lambert and Beth Ditto. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/mar/23/sam-sparro-george-michael-has-been-done-an-injustice-we-need-to-keep-sharing-his-stories">Continue reading...</a>

Radical shakeup of dinosaur family tree points to unexpected Scottish origins

<description>
<p>Cat-sized Scottish fossil proposed as candidate for common dinosaur ancestor in controversial study that could overthrow a century of dinosaur classification</p><p>The most radical shakeup of the dinosaur family tree in a century has led scientists to propose an unlikely origin for the prehistoric beasts: an obscure cat-sized creature found in Scotland.</p><p>The analysis, which has already sparked controversy in the academic world, suggests that the two basic groups into which dinosaurs have been classified for more than a century need a fundamental rethink. If proved correct, the revised version of the family tree would overthrow some of the most basic assumptions about this chapter of evolutionary history, including what the common ancestor of all dinosaurs looked like and where it came from.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/22/scottish-fossil-may-cause-radical-shakeup-of-dinosaur-family-tree-saltopus">Continue reading...</a>

Welcome to Yiwu: China's testing ground for a multicultural city

https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/23/welcome-yiwu-china-testing-ground-multicultural-city
</link>
<description>
<p>Unlike Guangzhou’s African community – who have faced prejudice and hostility – Yiwu’s foreign residents enjoy an ‘unusual freedom of worship’, with the municipal government even consulting international traders on city business</p><p>After dark on Exotic Street in China’s eastern city of Yiwu, three Yemeni boys crowd round a large charcoal barbecue rack selling lamb kebabs and baked breads. They order in confident Mandarin, chatting rapidly between themselves in Arabic.</p><p>Inside the adjoining Erbil restaurant, two Jordanian men share a plate heaped with barbecued meat and vegetables, while on the street corner two men sit smoking shisha pipes. The Zekeen supermarket sells both instant noodles and halal meat, and an African woman wearing a hijab carries out bags of shopping. Opposite, two young Russian women emerge from a shop that sells the unlikely combination of trainers and sex toys. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/23/welcome-yiwu-china-testing-ground-multicultural-city">Continue reading...</a>

Uber for bikes: how 'dockless' cycles flooded China – and are heading overseas

<description>
<p>New cycle-share firms in China allow you to simply drop your bike wherever you want. They have caused colourful chaos – and world cities could be next</p><p>On a 30ft-wide screen in Hangzhou’s public bike share office, the counter ticks up relentlessly: 278,812 … 278,847 … 278,883 … Another 40 cycle rentals every couple of seconds. The system will easily top 350,000 before this bitterly cold winter day is out.</p><p>On the left of the giant screen, the world’s 15 biggest public bike shares are ranked. Thirteen of them are in China. (Paris is No 5 with 21,000 bikes, and London No 12, with 16,500). Hangzhou – an hour west of Shanghai by bullet train – is slightly larger than London by population, but its share system is five times the size. It comfortably tops the table with 84,100 cycles, almost twice as many as its nearest rival. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/22/bike-wars-dockless-china-millions-bicycles-hangzhou">Continue reading...</a>

Argentina face must-win game against Chile amid deep economic uncertainty

<description>
It may not be a crisis yet but it will be if Argentina’s bogey team Chile defeat Edgardo Bauza’s side yet again<p>Whatever happens on Thursday, Chile will haunt this generation of Argentinian players for ever. The two sides met in the 2015 Copa América final and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/26/chile-win-copa-america-argentina-match-report-penalty-shoot-out">the 2016 Copa América Centenario final</a> and on both occasions Chile won on penalties after a 0-0 draw, extending the Argentinian trophy drought that stretches back to 1993. As Argentina face the possibility of failing to qualify for a World Cup for the first time since 1970, Chile, who have a knack of stopping them from playing, are probably the last team they want to be facing.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/22/world-cup-russia-2018-frontrunners-argentina-brazil-germany-france">Russia 2018 World Cup: how the main contenders are shaping up</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/mar/23/argentina-chile-world-cup-lionel-messi">Continue reading...</a>

Dele Alli sparkles for England to suggest there is life after Wayne Rooney | Barney Ronay

<description>
<p>The Tottenham Hotspur forward showed fine movement and cute attacking play, but just lacked a goal to mark him out as the game’s most valuable performer</p><p>On a still, at times rather slow-burn night in Dortmund England did enough to win, ended up losing, but still looked in patches like a team feeling away at the edges of its new shape, exploring with interest some new post‑Rooney attacking gears.</p><p>By the end they had also received a lesson in how to win, in the importance of cold hard edge in between the grace notes. Lukas Podolski hadn’t really done much by the 69th minute of this match. He touched the ball thirty times in all, chugged about eagerly, perhaps looked a little puffed towards the end. But when the ball did finally arrive at his feet in just the right spot he took the game away from England, looking up, seeing the space in front of him and spanking a wonderful shot into the top corner past Joe Hart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/mar/23/dele-alli-england-life-after-wayne-rooney">Continue reading...</a>

Lukas Podolski’s farewell stunner for Germany sinks new-look England

<description>
<p>The harsh reality for Gareth Southgate is that his first match since taking the England job full-time has ended in another reminder of Germany’s remarkable knack for winning football matches. The world champions have still not conceded a goal since Euro 2016, a sequence now incorporating seven games – or, to put it another way, almost 11 hours of football – and they managed to win their latest assignment while always giving the impression they would happily go through the entire game at three‑quarter pace.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/mar/22/germany-1-0-england-five-talking-points-from-international-friendly">Germany 1-0 England: five talking points from the friendly in Dortmund | Jamie Jackson</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/22/germany-england-international-friendly-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

• World No2 loses 2&amp;1 to Dane but says ‘I played well’<br />• ‘If I had played anyone else I might have won’<p>The good news for Rory McIlroy relates to the WGC Match Play format. The bad? A year ago only one player, Dustin Johnson, succumbed to an opening-day defeat and recovered sufficiently to progress to the knockout stage.</p><p>McIlroy’s 2&amp;1 humbling by Soren Kjeldsen, the world No68, was no disgrace given the inspired performance of the Dane. The pair would have produced a better ball score of 11 under par through 17 holes, with Kjeldsen minus six on his own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/mar/22/rory-mcilroy-beaten-by-soren-kjeldsen-wgc-match-play-opener">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
Whatever happens at Sunday’s Australian Grand Prix there are already good reasons for fans to be excited about the future<p>The waiting is over and Melbourne is abuzz with anticipation and the feeling, shared by Formula One fans across the world, that this is going to be a big weekend. Friday practice will be the first indicator of pace after the poker hands of testing in Barcelona; Saturday’s qualifying will be cards on the table time to discover who can turn any pace into a hot lap. Race day is crunch time for the teams but this year, with new regulations, it is also going to be a huge moment for the sport. A new start in a new era.</p><p>But it is hard not to sense an undertone of unease. What if F1 has got it wrong? Ross Brawn, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/02/ross-brawn-formula-one-liberty-media" title="">appointed by the owner, Liberty Media, as Formula One’s director of motorsport</a>, has already made it clear there will be no knee-jerk reactions to an unsuccessful reboot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/mar/22/f1-season-new-rules-optimism-australian-grand-prix-melbourne">Continue reading...</a>

The Guardian view on the Westminster attack: solidarity against terror | Editorial

<p>It is the moment everyone feared would come. But it must be kept in proportion</p><p>It was only ever a matter of time. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/mar/22/peers-say-brexit-with-no-trade-deal-would-cause-signicicant-damage-to-service-sector-politics-live" title="">This strike at parliament</a> took aim directly at the heart of British democracy. It was perhaps meant to reach the prime minister – for today, the day of prime minister’s questions, was the one day when her movements would be well known – but more probably it was, like the attack in Berlin just before Christmas, simply an attempt to hit at a European centre of power. The earlier car attack on the&nbsp;dozens of tourists and office workers and three police officers on their way back from a commendation ceremony, caught walking across Westminster Bridge around 2.45pm, was plainly intended to magnify the terror.</p><p>This is the moment that everyone planned for and hoped would never happen, the Metropolitan police acting deputy commissioner, Mark Rowley, said at his first news conference afterwards. It was also the hardest kind of attack to stop, an apparently lone terrorist using low-tech weaponry seeking to do maximum harm, almost certain of death himself. He got through, but&nbsp;a dozen or more attacks have been foiled in Britain since 2013, 10 of them in the past two years. More than 500 live counter-terror investigations are under way at any given moment, Mr Rowley said recently. The police and the security forces have to be right all the time. The terrorists only need to be lucky once. It is important to hold on to that truth, and to remember that, terrible as the loss of life has been and grim as the aftermath will be, no one would want to live in the kind of world where such an attack had been made entirely impossible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/the-guardian-view-on-the-westminster-attack-solidarity-against-terror">Continue reading...</a>

Rex Tillerson is clearly out of the loop and out of his depth in Trumpland | Jonathan Freedland

<description>
The former oil executive’s apparent reluctance to be Trump’s secretary of state could be a sign that he knew he’d be serving in a sham administration<p>There is a charitable reading of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/22/rex-tillerson-i-didnt-want-this-job">Rex Tillerson’s</a> interview with the previously obscure Independent Journal Review. When the secretary of state told the IJR that “I didn’t want this job, I didn’t seek this job,” that he was “stunned” when Donald Trump offered it to him, and that he only did it because “my wife told me I’m supposed to do this,” it’s possible that he was displaying a charming modesty. Think of it as an elaborate version of the formulation favoured by celebrities on receiving an award: “I’m humbled.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/22/rex-tillerson-i-didnt-want-this-job">Rex Tillerson: 'I didn't want this job … my wife told me I'm supposed to do this'</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/rex-tillerson-out-loop-trump-secretary-state">Continue reading...</a>

He did not, as some have suggested, have a Damascene conversion: he believed in a united Ireland. Sinn Féin is more determined than ever to deliver that goal<p>The death of my friend and comrade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/21/martin-mcguinness-sinn-fein-members-carry-coffin-home-in-derry" title="">Martin McGuinness</a> has left a deep void. It is a huge blow to all of us who knew and loved him, especially his wife and family. Martin was an extraordinary human being. Funny, caring, a committed family man, a keen fisherman, an enthusiast for all kinds of sport from cricket to hurling. He loved Derry. The city – along with his wife, Bernie, his family and his mother, Peggy – moulded him into the complex, compassionate, warm, human being he was.</p><p>Martin was also a deeply committed Irish republican activist who in his youth was confronted by the naked sectarianism and injustice of the British state in Ireland, and stood strong against it. As a result he was imprisoned and spent long periods on the run.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/martin-mcguinness-republican-united-ireland-sinn-fein">Continue reading...</a>

It’s vital the chancellor steps up to ensure the financial system is fit for purpose – especially taxpayer-owned RBS – to restore the public’s confidence in it<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/police-to-examine-global-laundromat-money-laundering-allegations" title="">revelations published in the Guardian yesterday</a> about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/21/russia-accused-of-hindering-uk-money-laundering-investigations?CMP=share_btn_tw" title="">criminal network that is processing money through major British banks</a> are a damning indictment of the failings of our banking system. For a period of at least four years, shortly after the financial crisis in the early 2010s, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/british-banks-handled-vast-sums-of-laundered-russian-money" title="">Russian criminal interests moved nearly $740m through British banks</a>, including HSBC, RBS, Barclays, Lloyds and Coutts, with HSBC as the largest conduit by far.</p><p>They could do this, despite regulations expressly designed to prevent such activity taking place. Yet, when presented with a series of urgent questions, demanding answers and action, the response from the government was astonishingly complacent. A mere week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/mar/15/hammonds-nics-u-turn-is-a-political-disaster-for-the-government" title="">the self-employment tax U-turn</a>, it is following a path well-worn since 2010 – pathetically easy on the big banks and the super-rich, but tough on those just trying to earn a living.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/22/dirty-money-uk-banks-rbs-laundromat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At least 33 people killed in coalition strike on school used as refugee centre near jihadi-held town in northern province of Raqqa, says monitor</p><p>An airstrike by the US-led coalition against Islamic State on a school west of the Syrian city of Raqqa has killed at least 33 people, many of whom had fled nearby fighting, sparking further concerns that new rules of engagements may be causing an increase in civilian casualties.</p><p>The attack follows a separate US strike on a mosque complex in the north-west of the country last Saturday that killed at least 52 people. The incident triggered fears that a White House-ordered review of rules governing the use of drones had already given military planners more flexibility on ordering strikes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/dozens-dead-in-us-led-syria-airstrike-al-mansoura">Continue reading...</a>

A kaleidoscope of legs: Busby Berkeley's flamboyant dance fantasies
</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/23/busby-berkeley-dance-42nd-street-choreography-film-musicals
</link>
<description>
<p>In hit movies like 42nd Street, Berkeley liberated dance from the stage and placed it in a purely cinematic dimension with dizzyingly inventive routines</p><p>A new West End production of 42nd Street opens this month and its mix of high glamour and romantic nostalgia may prove a fitting escapist fantasy for our uncertain times. In 1933, the original movie was designed to beguile and distract a suffering US. President Roosevelt’s programmes for rebooting the economy had yet to take effect, and the movie’s audience was desperate for the temporary relief of big-budget effects, big-name stars and the 200 “gorgeous girls” that the trailer promised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/23/busby-berkeley-dance-42nd-street-choreography-film-musicals">Continue reading...</a>

Why denying refugees the right to work is a catastrophic error | Paul Collier and Alexander Betts

</link>
<description>
<p>It’s not just fleeing conflict that makes victims out of refugees – it’s also denying them the means to become autonomous and productive</p><p>From the 1980s on, a dominant international approach has been taken towards the majority of the world’s refugees. Concentrated in a small number of host countries, close to war zones, displaced people have been settled in what have become known as “humanitarian silos”. Such places are usually remote, arid, dangerous and almost always have strict prohibitions on socio-economic activity. They are designed to deal only with the emergency phase of refugee intake, and yet the model has endured, leaving individuals and families stranded for years at a time.</p><p>This strategy undermines autonomy and dignity. It also erodes human potential by focusing almost exclusively on people’s vulnerabilities, rather than on rebuilding their lives. Inevitably, many of those directly affected by it become disillusioned and choose to move on, gravitating towards urban areas in the host nation or risking their lives crossing oceans to other countries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/why-denying-refugees-the-right-to-work-is-a-catastrophic-error">Continue reading...</a>

Why becoming a tax haven would be bad news for Britain

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/tax-haven-theresa-may-bad-news-britain-brexit
</link>
<description>
<p>Theresa May and Philip Hammond have warned the EU that if they don’t like the Brexit deal, they could turn the UK into a tax haven. The truth is that being ‘offshore’ means being unfair and undemocratic – and you still pay tax</p><p>Most of us take democracy for granted, but you would have to think again if you lived in a tax haven. <a href="https://theconversation.com/fear-smear-and-the-paradox-of-authoritarian-politics-in-singapore-47763">Singapore has had the same party in power since 1959</a>. Jersey, meanwhile, has never had a general election, the members of its parliament (the States) being subject to re-election at varying times. But at least Jersey has a political party – called Reform Jersey – even if it only holds three seats in the States. All the remaining elected politicians claim to be independents, although they seem to have a decidedly pro-finance approach in common. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-guernsey-35250851">Neighbouring Guernsey has no parties at all</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/22/tax-haven-theresa-may-bad-news-britain-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>The Australian novel has been adapted for US screens, leaving behind both Sydney’s northern beaches and the nuance</p><p>“It had never crossed her mind that sending your child to school would be like going back to school yourself.” </p><p>The Australian author Liane Moriarty is a master of suburban secrets and lies (particularly among the white middle class), and her 2014 novel, Big Little Lies, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/review-big-little-lies-by-liane-moriarty-20140723-zvmtf.html">was lauded</a> for being uncomfortably recognisable in its absurdity. The book is full of knowing humour about the first year of school in a Sydney beach suburb, where the adults needed more watching than the children; anyone who has come into proximity with a primary school will know the obsessive politics that go into planning the sausage sizzles and trivia nights. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/23/has-the-satire-and-humour-of-big-little-lies-been-lost-in-translation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Melissa Leo stars in Netflix’s upcoming biopic of the contentious figure who was ridiculed and largely forgotten about – but who often talked sense<br></p><p>This week, the film <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80082242">The Most Hated Woman in America</a> comes to Netflix, with Melissa Leo playing Madalyn Murray O’Hair, the atheist who campaigned against the church’s influence in public and political life (the title comes from the headline on a 1964 interview with her in Life magazine). While Murray O’Hair is not widely known outside of the US, she had an extraordinary life. Long before the likes of Richard Dawkins, she gained notoriety for helping to push bible readings out of schools, and in 1963 she founded American Atheists. It’s a group that is still going today, campaigning against Donald Trump’s plan to abolish the rule that forbids religious institutions, among other charitable organisations, from getting involved in political activity and funding). For the next few decades, Murray O’Hair devoted her life to campaigning against the church’s power. She was a contentious figure, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jun/04/features11.g23">when she disappeared in 1995,</a> along with her son and granddaughter from their home in Austin, Texas, that too was controversial.</p><p>People wondered whether there could be a sinister explanation. With still no sign of the family eight months on, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/21/us/3-top-leaders-missing-atheist-group-is-adrift.html">a piece in the New York Times</a> suggested that there were “two widely discussed explanations about the disappearances”. The first was that the trio had gone on the run with money they’d embezzled from the organisation. “The other,” they reported, “is that Mrs O’Hair, 77, diabetic and in declining health, was taking action on her desire to die without others praying over her corpse.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2017/mar/22/how-atheist-campaigner-madalyn-murray-ohair-became-americas-most-hated-woman">Continue reading...</a>

Apple is tired of making Coca-Cola and now wants to sell champagne | Alex Hern

<p>The company’s philosophy once followed Warhol’s line about Coke. But with a premium iPhone Pro rumoured, this sense of egalitarianism no longer applies</p><p>For the past decade, Apple’s philosophy has been summed up by an Andy Warhol line about Coca-Cola.</p><p>“What’s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest,” Warhol wrote <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Andy-Warhol-Penguin-Classics/dp/014118910X/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">in his 1975 autobiography</a>. “You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the president drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/22/apple-iphone-pro-rumour-coca-cola-champagne-premium-consumers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Man who castigated the monarchy in 1977 single God Save the Queen says he will miss the Queen ‘as a human being’, and that he loves royal pageantry</p><p>God Save the Queen – he means it, man. John Lydon has said will “sorely miss” Britain’s monarch when she dies. The Sex Pistols/Public Image Ltd singer was appearing on the Quietus video hour when conversation turned to the topic of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/16/what-happens-when-queen-elizabeth-dies-london-bridge">plans for the death of Queen Elizabeth II</a>.</p><p>Host John Doran, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-doran">a Guardian music contributor</a>, asked Lydon if he was worried about how the Sex Pistols’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqrAPOZxgzU">God Save the Queen</a> might be used. After saying the song was “about a political situation and the demand for obedience to a monarchy I don’t believe in”, Lydon moved on to the question of the Queen as a person, and said: “I would sorely miss her as a human being on planet Earth.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/23/john-lydon-queen-god-save-monarchy-sex-pistols">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Trisha Brown obituary</title>

https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/22/trisha-brown-obituary
</link>
<description>
Influential US choreographer first admired for her spare, subversive dances who underwent a radical shift as she was gripped by ‘a rapture to move’<p>Trisha Brown, who has died aged 80, was widely acclaimed as one of the most gifted and influential choreographers of her generation but it was typical of her witty yet functional approach to dance that she was more inclined to describe herself as “a bricklayer with a sense of humour”. When a group of critics made the mistake of assuming that “anyone” could perform the deceptively laid-back choreography of her masterpiece, Set and Reset, Brown was caustic. “Don’t they realise we rearrange our internal organs every time we dance it?”</p><p>Brown grew up in Aberdeen, Washington state, the daughter of Martell Brown, a salesman, and his wife, Dorothy (nee Abel), a teacher. After graduating from Weatherwax high school in the city in 1954 she went to Mills College, in Oakland, California, to study modern dance, supplementing her course with the <a href="http://www.americandancefestival.org/" title="">American Dance Festival</a>’s annual summer school, where her teachers included the choreographer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mercecunningham" title="">Merce Cunningham</a> and the veteran dance and music pedagogue Louis Horst.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/22/trisha-brown-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<title>Amy Winehouse – 10 of the best</title>
<link>
https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/mar/22/amy-winehouse-10-of-the-best
</link>
<description>
<p>Winehouse’s heart belonged to jazz and 60s girl groups, but she was also inspired by hip-hop and Latin music. Here are some of her finest songs</p><p>Although Amy Winehouse attended the Brit School and was initially on Simon Fuller’s management books alongside S Club 7 and Gareth Gates, her heart belonged to jazz and 1960s girl groups. In itself, her idolisation of Dinah Washington and the Ronettes distinguished her from almost all newly minted pop singers of the early 2000s; her exceptionally-susceptible-to-heartbreak voice did the rest. Yet she didn’t exist in a retro bubble. She covered the jazz standard ’Round Midnight as the B-side to her second single, Take the Box, and produced a freewheeling track that reflected her less publicised love of hip-hop and Latin. Even more than the version used for the B-side, <a draggable="true" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32_jWTV41Cw">an alternate take</a> presents her as young and in love with music: she scats, vamps and plays with the beat, just because she can. The influence of Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill is obvious, and there’s a touch of cabaret, but at around the 1:10 mark she casually bends a series of notes, and the rest of the track flows from there. As one of the most covered jazz songs, ’Round Midnight presented a challenge, but she was completely at ease with its yearning and sensuality. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/mar/22/amy-winehouse-10-of-the-best">Continue reading...</a>

<description>
<p>A cooked breakfast needn’t mean a pile of grease. Try introducing baked eggs to dal or scrambling some fragrantly spiced tofu to wrap in a warm tortilla for a healthy start to the day</p><p>Weekend breakfasts deserve more than the neat routine of Monday to Friday: porridge or marmalade on toast just don’t cut it for me on a Sunday. I don’t even crave a weekend fry-up these days. No, I need something substantial, but without the grease, which is where some experimentation has come in lately.</p><p>On the weekends we are at home, those moments between getting up and heading out are precious; rare slices of time when the phone doesn’t ring. My little boy busily runs laps of the kitchen as I cook with the sole purpose of making something delicious. Here are two things I have cooked in these morning windows, and they’re set to be cooked over and over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/21/vegetarian-cooked-breakfast-recipes-dal-baked-eggs-black-bean-tofu-scramble-anna-jones">Continue reading...</a>
